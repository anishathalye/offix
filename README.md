This documentation is decent, but it isn't super detailed, at least not yet. If
you're trying to set this up and have any questions, feel free to [open an
issue][issue] or send me an email (me@anishathalye.com).

## Hardware Setup

* Raspberry Pi
    * Ralink RT5370
        * Works out of the box with Raspbian Jessie, supports monitor mode

## Software Setup

There are three main components in OffiX: a [WiFi sniffer](offix-sniffer/), a
[web interface](offix-web/), and the [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/)
[plugin](hubot-offix/). Information about each component is in its own
directory.

### System Setup

To configure a static IP address, edit `/etc/network/interfaces` and add the
following:

```
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
	address x.x.x.x
	netmask x.x.x.x
	gateway x.x.x.x
```

To put the wifi card in monitor mode, run the following:

```bash
sudo ifconfig wlan0 down
sudo iwconfig wlan0 mode monitor
sudo ifconfig wlan0 up
```

**Note: This needs to be run on every reboot!**

To install node/npm on the Raspberry Pi, run:

```bash
wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.4/node-v4.2.4-linux-armv6l.tar.gz
cd /usr/local
sudo tar xzvf ~/node-v4.2.4-linux-armv6l.tar.gz --strip=1
```

**Note: These installation instructions are for a 1st-generation Raspberry Pi
that has an ARMv6 CPU. If you're using a newer Raspberry Pi, download the
appropriate version of node from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).**

To install RabbitMQ on the Raspberry Pi, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server
```

To install MongoDB on the Raspberry Pi, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mongodb
```

## Architecture

The WiFi sniffer and web interface are meant to run on the Raspberry Pi. The
two communicate via a [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) instance running on
the Raspberry Pi.

## Development Tips

* This project uses [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/)
